Welcome to **Playcraft AI** — where gameplay meets generative intelligence.

We're a consulting and R&D practice helping mobile game studios boost *player retention and lifetime value (LTV)* using **on-device machine learning**.

### Why On-Device AI?

Most studios today are investing in backend AI services, but we believe the future is distributed:

- No server costs for inference — your users' devices handle the compute.
- Faster response times and offline support.
- Reduced bandwidth and backend infrastructure expenses.
- Personalized models trained privately and locally — better UX and data privacy.

Our approach is practical, not theoretical. We're not building story-driven NPCs or cinematic agents — we're here to **move business metrics** like engagement and retention with scalable, device-efficient micro models.

### What's Next?

We’ll be sharing technical experiments, prototype demos, and open-source tools that help developers integrate small, fast, and smart models into mobile games. If you're working on a game and want to explore this kind of edge AI, we’d love to hear from you.

Stay tuned — or [contact us](mailto:info@playcraftai.com) if you're ready to start now.
