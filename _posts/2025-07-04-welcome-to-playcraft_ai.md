Welcome to **Playcraft AI** — where gameplay evolves with you.

Imagine a toy that becomes more of the toy you want and love the more you play with it. That’s what Playcraft AI aims to do: transform static game loops into living, responsive experiences that learn from each player and adapt in real time.

We're a consulting and R&D practice focused on helping mobile game studios boost **player retention** and **lifetime value (LTV)** — not by tuning difficulty curves or tweaking ad timers, but by making gameplay itself feel more personal, more rewarding, and more alive.

### Gameplay That Learns You

At the core of Playcraft AI is a simple but powerful idea: games should get better the more you play — **for you specifically**.

- In a casual puzzle game, what's the next color drop that will delight, not frustrate?
- In a word game, what kind of challenge makes *you* keep playing?
- In a card game, what dynamic should show up next to keep flow and surprise alive?
- In a daily challenge, what pacing and tension fit your play style?

This isn’t just personalization around the edges — this is about **using AI to change the gameplay itself**. Not by crafting endless branches or tuning a million knobs, but through **lightweight, player-trained models** that adjust how the game behaves based on what makes each user tick.

### Why On-Device?

To pull this off, we don’t rely on heavy cloud services or centralized data hoarding. We believe the most scalable, private, and performant approach is **on-device machine learning** — micro-models that run locally on the player’s phone or tablet.

- **Fast**: No server calls = instant responsiveness.
- **Private**: No personal data leaves the device unless the player chooses to share.
- **Offline Ready**: Personalization doesn’t break when connectivity does.
- **Cost-Efficient**: Skip the cloud inference bill.

### What's Next

We’re building:

- Prototype gameplay systems powered by edge-trained AI
- Open source tools for integrating personalization into casual mobile games
- Thought leadership and experiments to push what's possible with small models and real gameplay change

Whether you’re tuning a word game, building a new match-3, or wondering what comes *after* “live ops,” we’d love to collaborate.
