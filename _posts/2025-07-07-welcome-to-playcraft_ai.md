Welcome to **Playcraft AI** ‚Äî where gameplay evolves with you.

Imagine a toy that becomes more of the toy you want and love the more you play with it. That‚Äôs what Playcraft AI aims to do: transform static game loops into living, responsive experiences that learn from each player and adapt in real time.

We're a consulting and R&D practice focused on helping mobile game studios boost **player retention** and **lifetime value (LTV)** ‚Äî not by tuning difficulty curves or tweaking ad timers, but by making gameplay itself feel more personal, more rewarding, and more alive.

### Gameplay That Learns You

At the core of Playcraft AI is a simple but powerful idea: games should get better the more you play ‚Äî **for you specifically**.

- In a casual puzzle game, what's the next color drop that will delight, not frustrate?
- In a word game, what kind of challenge makes *you* keep playing?
- In a card game, what dynamic should show up next to keep flow and surprise alive?
- In a daily challenge, what pacing and tension fit your play style?

This isn‚Äôt just personalization around the edges ‚Äî this is about **using AI to change the gameplay itself**. Not by crafting endless branches or tuning a million knobs, but through **lightweight, player-trained models** that adjust how the game behaves based on what makes each user tick.

### Why On-Device?

To pull this off, we don‚Äôt rely on heavy cloud services or centralized data hoarding. We believe the most scalable, private, and performant approach is **on-device machine learning** ‚Äî micro-models that run locally on the player‚Äôs phone or tablet.

- **Fast**: No server calls = instant responsiveness.
- **Private**: No personal data leaves the device unless the player chooses to share.
- **Offline Ready**: Personalization doesn‚Äôt break when connectivity does.
- **Cost-Efficient**: Skip the cloud inference bill.

### On-Device Personalization Architecture

Each player‚Äôs experience adapts in real time through lightweight preference vectors that guide an embedded on-device model ‚Äî powered by Unity Sentis for speed, privacy, and personalization without backend dependencies.

  üß† <strong>Not using Unity?</strong> Or need to integrate a large pre-trained model like an LLM?<br>
  In those cases, your best bet might be the general-purpose architecture we use for non-Unity workflows.

### What's Next

We‚Äôre building:

- Prototype gameplay systems powered by on-device, player-trained AI
- Proprietary tools for integrating real-time personalization into casual mobile games
- Thought leadership and experimental demos that explore the frontier of lightweight, impactful game AI


Whether you‚Äôre tuning a word game, building a new match-3, or wondering what comes *after* ‚Äúlive ops,‚Äù we‚Äôd love to collaborate.
