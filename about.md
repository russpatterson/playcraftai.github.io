# About Playcraft AI

**Playcraft AI** is a consulting and R&D practice focused on helping mobile game studios improve **player retention** and **lifetime value** through on-device machine learning.

Unlike many teams chasing story-driven AI and NPC behavior, we specialize in pragmatic, business-critical AI systems that make games more engaging and profitable. By running personalized models directly on each player's device, studios avoid server costs and network bottlenecksâ€”offloading compute to the user while delivering low-latency, resilient experiences.

We're not here to follow trends. We're here to move the needle with measurable results.
