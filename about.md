# About Playcraft AI

**Playcraft AI** is a consulting and R&D practice helping mobile game studios grow **player retention** and **lifetime value (LTV)** with smarter, more responsive gameplay powered by **on-device machine learning**.

We donâ€™t build AI for cutscenes or conversation treesâ€”we build AI that makes the core gameplay feel more **alive**, **adaptive**, and **tailored to each player**. Whether you're running a match-3 game, a word puzzle, or a card battler, we help you:

- Predict what move will delight or frustrate next
- Adjust pacing, challenge, and flow to fit a playerâ€™s style
- Keep sessions feeling fresh without server-side orchestration

Our models run directly on the player's deviceâ€”no cloud latency, no server bills, no privacy worries. This means **fast, private, offline-ready personalization** that scales with your player base, not your AWS bill.

We're not chasing trends. We're delivering results: longer play sessions, better retention curves, and real gains in LTV.
